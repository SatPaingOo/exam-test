# 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED - READ THIS FIRST! 🚨

## The deployment workflow is now fixed, but you need to change ONE setting in GitHub:

### Go Here NOW:
👉 https://github.com/SatPaingOo/exam-test/settings/pages

### Change This:
```
Source: [GitHub Actions] ❌ WRONG
   ↓
Source: [Deploy from a branch] ✅ CORRECT

Then select:
Branch: [gh-pages] [/ (root)] [Save]
```

### That's It!
After changing this setting, your site will deploy successfully at:
**https://satpaingoo.github.io/exam-test/**

---

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for full details and troubleshooting.
