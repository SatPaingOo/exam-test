# GitHub Pages Deployment - FIXED ✅

## What Was Wrong:
1. ❌ Missing `package-lock.json` file (needed for `npm ci`)
2. ❌ Environment protection rules blocking deployment
3. ❌ Workflow using GitHub Actions Pages deployment (requires environment setup)

## What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Changed `npm ci` to `npm install` (no lock file needed)
2. ✅ Simplified workflow to deploy directly to `gh-pages` branch
3. ✅ Removed environment protection complexity

---

## IMPORTANT: Update GitHub Settings

**You MUST change your GitHub Pages settings for this to work:**

### Step-by-Step:
1. Go to: `https://github.com/SatPaingOo/exam-test/settings/pages`
2. Under **"Source"**, change from **"GitHub Actions"** to **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Under **"Branch"**, select:
   - Branch: **gh-pages**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
4. Click **"Save"**

### Visual Guide:
```
Settings → Pages

Source:  [Deploy from a branch ▼]  (NOT "GitHub Actions")

Branch:  [gh-pages ▼]  [/ (root) ▼]  [Save]
```

---

## How It Works Now:

### Workflow Process:
1. You push code to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions runs automatically:
   - ✅ Installs Node.js 18
   - ✅ Runs `npm install`
   - ✅ Runs `npm run build`
   - ✅ Deploys `dist` folder to `gh-pages` branch
3. GitHub Pages serves from `gh-pages` branch

### Your Site URL:
```
https://satpaingoo.github.io/exam-test/
```

### Branches:
- **main** - Your development branch (keep working here)
- **gh-pages** - Auto-created deployment branch (don't touch this)

---

## Monitoring Deployments

### Check Workflow Status:
1. Go to: `https://github.com/SatPaingOo/exam-test/actions`
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflows
3. Green ✅ = Success | Red ❌ = Failed

### Check Pages Status:
1. Go to: `https://github.com/SatPaingOo/exam-test/settings/pages`
2. You'll see: "Your site is live at https://satpaingoo.github.io/exam-test/"

---

## After Changing Settings:

The workflow that's currently running will:
1. Create the `gh-pages` branch (if it doesn't exist)
2. Deploy your built files there
3. GitHub Pages will automatically serve your site

**Wait 1-2 minutes after the workflow completes, then visit:**
```
https://satpaingoo.github.io/exam-test/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "environment protection rules" error?
- Make sure you changed the Source to "Deploy from a branch" in Settings → Pages

### Site shows 404?
- Wait 2-3 minutes after first deployment
- Check that `gh-pages` branch exists in your repository
- Verify the base path in `vite.config.js` is `/exam-test/`

### Workflow fails on build step?
- Check the Actions logs for specific errors
- Test locally: `npm install && npm run build`

---

## Optional Improvements

### Add package-lock.json for faster builds:
```bash
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add package-lock.json"
git push origin main
```

Then update workflow to use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for faster, more reliable builds.
